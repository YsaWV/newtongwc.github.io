<p>Overall project description: To tell people about internet addiction how it can harm then, what it is, and how you can stop it.  Users will be asked to ask any questions they might have about internet addiction.  A sprite will then answer them if it can and if not the sprite would say, "I need to do more research on that." or "that is not relevant at this time" or just plain "I don't know" or "I can't answer that at this time."  Game overall: Flappy bird sort of game. When you die you have to answer a question. Get it right you move on, get it wrong you have to start from the beginning of the game.
