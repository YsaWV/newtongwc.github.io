This is a webpage for the final projects of the <a href="http://www.newtongwc.org">Newton Girls Who Code</a> club. 
    

Soon we'll have separate pages for the two sections:
<ul>
  <li>Ada Lovelace session (Monday nights)</li>
  <li>Grace Hopper session (Friday afternoons)</li>
</ul>

    We are a Girls Who Code Club based in Newton MA. We are using the programming skills that we have developed over this year to create a website about cybersecurity. In the age of technology, we believe that it is important to understand how to use the internet safely. We have created interactive games to educate you about the dangers of the internet and how to protect yourself from being a victim of a cyber-attack. <br>
